## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Download and install [QT 5.15](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source) using the online installer. Make sure to use MinGW 64 bit build of QT.

This is required to modify and build the launcher.

### Installing & Making Changes

1. Import the cloned project into QT Creator
1. Change out key assets to represent your mod:
   * resource/background.png : Main dialog background
   * resource/executable/mod.pk3 : Compiled mod (currently only supports single PK3)
   * resource/executable/mod.ini : Custom mod configuration
1. Build and run

### Deployment

#### Windows

1. Build in QT Creator, using the above process
1. Copy the `ZandronumLauncher.exe` from debug build folder used by QT to a new empty deployment folder
1. Copy everything from `resource/executable/generic` and `resource/executable/win` to the same new folder. Do not include the sub-directories, just the content files.
1. Run the QT deployment executable, to pull in all the DLLs. Make sure to change based on your QT build and MinGW build.
   * Example: `PATH=$PATH:/c/Qt/Tools/mingw810_64/bin/ /c/Qt/5.15.2/mingw81_64/bin/windeployqt.exe --debug ZandronumLauncher.exe`
